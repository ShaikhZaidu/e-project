About The Item:
Fossil has always been inspired by American creativity and ingenuity. Since 1984, weâ€™ve strived to bring new life into the industry by making quality, fashionable watches and accessories that were both fun and accessible.
Our Scarlette Mini watch features an elegant case and effortless, easy-to-wear size. Featuring time-honored Roman numerals and sticks set with even more sparkle, it's a decidedly feminine take on one of our favorite tom(girl) watches.

Two-tone stainless steel case with gold sunray dial; silver and gold-tone stainless steel bracelet band with 2-pusher foldover clasp closure
