Description:
We have reimagined our Timex Ironman Rugged 30 collection with rich metallic accents to take you outside the gym. It still has everything athletes love, 30-lap memory, timers, alarms and our Indiglo night-light. There are 640 muscles in the human body and Rugged 30 is designed to fit, flex and wear like the 641st. Workout-ready with a digital stopwatch, timers and alarms, it’s tough enough for ten more “reps” and the rest of your day.
